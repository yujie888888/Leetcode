/**
 * Imagine that there are several lamps placed on a number line, each of which illuminates some segment of the line.
 * Specifically, the lamps are represented in a two-dimensional array lamps, where the ith lamp covers the segment
 * from lamps[i][0] to lamps[i][1], inclusive.
 * Additionally, you are given a list of control points on this number line, represented by an array points.
 * Your task is to find the number of lamps that illuminate each control point.
 * Specifically, for each control point points[j] in the array, your task is to find the number of lamps
 * lamps[i] which include this point within its covered segment - when points[j] lies inside the segment [lamps[i][0], lamps[i][1]].
 * As a result, return an array of integers, where ith integer correspond to the answer for the ith control point.
 * Example
 * For lamps = [[1, 7], [5, 11], [7, 9]] and points = [7, 1, 5, 10, 9, 15], the
 * output should be solution(lamps, points) = [3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0].
